        Boston’s Main Era have steadily chiseled out their sound across a few short years,
    developed in no small part by the freewheeling, kaleidoscopic sound of their now-refined live shows •
    the band, comprised of Garrett Greaves, Jack Halberian, Maeve Malloy, & Willie Swift, aren’t content
    sticking within genre constrictions from track to track, or even within the same song on stage - 
    instruments are swapped, punk-ish rave-ups are followed by ambient sprawls, 
    found-sound samples are looped around slinking slowcore punctuated by shoegaze guitar heroics • 
    nothing much is obvious during one of their live sets, but this much is: 
    the sights & sounds of a band exuding a gleeful sense of chaotic camaraderie
        Thankfully, this feeling of open-world adventure translates well in a studio setting & is all over ‘the bank, a farmer’ - 
    a primal rhythm section underscores an angular post-punk break, 
    lyrical references to existentialist literature are bandied about by shuddering arpeggios, 
    volcanic stabs of fuzz give way to experimental rattle & dread • 
    although it isn’t clear where Main Era might go from here, old fans & new listeners alike can rest easy 
    knowing it’s a sonic patchwork well worth following - Candlepin Records</a><br> </font></p>
