            "Main Era consists of Willie Swift, Maeve Malloy, Jack Halberian, and Gigi Greaves. It also consists of their mutual and individual excitements and, feeding off of the chapters of their lives, phases, states, interests, etc; occasionally freezing them into the form of recorded music without ever freezing Main Era itself. When Willie and Gigi began the project four-ish years ago (I suppose this would be Main Era’s fetal – if not prenatal years) it honored their then-excitement about rapping and trap beats and served as an outlet for mutually experienced breakup woes. They added Jack around the time they decided to start playing shows, and then Maeve cemented the project in the summer of 2022. 

“If you go through the discography, there is definitely an evolution and there are still older tendencies or ideas that we used before that we expanded or improved upon, and then also newer things that we were inspired by,” Maeve notes. “We’ve never been like, “oh we’re going to be a rock band”, or “we’re going to be a shoegaze band” – though we did just inevitably fall under that umbrella and scene because it made the most sense sonically. But still, there has never been a goal like that, and, at least for me, I love the idea of just creating your own thing.” 

Main Era is set to share new record Four of Wands next month. The record features tracks mixed by Nate Scaringi and Cameron Woody, as well as cover art by JJ Gonson. They shared first single, “Double Dragon”, last month, and the entire record will be released January 23rd via Interluxe Distribution – an independent tape label that Main Era runs out of Boston." <a target="_blank" href = "https://uglyhug.com/2025/12/16/main-era-is-fused-by-excitement-interview/"> -The Ugly Hug 2025 </a>
 UPDATE: They will also release the album through fellow boston label "Disposable America"
